E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Implement a blockchain system to track e-waste from collection to final processing.
This increases transparency for users and ensures responsible recycling practices.
Users can view the journey of their e-waste and its environmental impact.
